#Module 4 Team Project
Your team is to write a program to print a number of options presented to the user and allow the user to select an option from the list.
The options should be numbered from 1 â€“ 9; although your team can use less than 9 options, but make sure there are at least 5 options. If the user selects a valid choice, the program should print a short message. The message should include the value that the user typed.
As an example, your program might look like the following:
Sample code(Image not coded)
In this example, the final option of '0' is added to the options to exit the program. You may use 'if' and 'elif' statements to complete the program.
Your program should be posted to Github, one of the team members should create a team GitHub account (separate account from the one you created in Module 2) for viewing by your team. Remember to add each one of your team members and your instructor to the Team GitHub account the same way you added your instructor to view code in GitHub.
Extra credit:
The team can modify the program so that it continues looping allowing the user to choose an option each time around. In this version, the program should only terminate when the user selects 0 (Exit).
